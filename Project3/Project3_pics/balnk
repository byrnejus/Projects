## 3.1 A More Realistic Model of The Earth-Sun System

Using the classes and the function that I defined above I am now going to look at a better model for the earth-sun system.  If you need to, you can see the basic example of our system [here](#cell2.0).  I will rebuild a new version of the model.  This time I will now simple assume r to be a constant, but will calculate it explicitly as

$$r=\sqrt{(x_{Earth}-x_{Sun})^2+(y_{Earth}-y_{Sun})^2}$$

I will also no longer take the position of the sun as stationary.  This time the Sun will also move.  In astronomy, the presence of planets is often infered by the pull of the planets on their star.  Though the motion is small the star will wobble as it is tugged by the planet.  Hopefully we will see a similar effect here. 

#Define time interval & step size
#Starting at t=0
t_0=0;t_f=10
n=100
h=(t_f-t_0)/n

#Initialize Vectors
Vectorize(n,h,t_0)
#Define Constants
GM_sun=(2*math.pi)**2;r=1
GM_Earth=1

# A Note For the Proffessor
#
# I was a little more frivolous when I was writing this project so the parts aren't necessarily done in the order (a,b,c...) in which they were presented.  Everything you asked for, and more, is in fact somewhere in this document.  If you have trouble finding anything do not hesitate to ask me.
