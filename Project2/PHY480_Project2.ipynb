    "The contents of the next few cells are examples of simple cases that I have constructed as a basis of reference for myself throughout the course of this project.  I include them because they have future value as a tool for understanding my own code.  I feel that a quick glance at these sections will offer the best idea of how much of the in-class material I am actually able to understand and that a review of later sections will offer an idea of what I am able to implement.  In this portion of the project I discuss the underlying theory and provide a simple example of Jacobi's algorithm. "

    "### Implement Jacobi's Method: 3X3 case\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory that lies at the heart of Jacobi's Algorithm is the similarity transformation.  We apply an n-dimensional \n",
    "rotational matrix about an arbitrary angle.  The goal is to choose this angle daftly such that the non-diagonal \n",
    "elements approach zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Cosider a matrix A:\n",
    "1.  Determine some tolernce limit $\\epsilon$\n",
    "2.  Pick out the largest Off(A) -> $Off(A)_{max}$.  If there is no largest element, that is that there are elements which are equally large then chose the element with lowest row index, if this is not sufficient then further chose the lowest column index.\n",
    "3.  Apply the similarity transformation to obtain an equation.  Chose $\\theta$ such that $Off(A)_{max} = 0$\n",
    "4.  Sum $Off(A)$ to ensure that $\\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\sum\\limits_{j=1,j\\neq i}^{n} Off(A)^2}\\leq \\epsilon$\n",
    "5.  Iterate this process until the condition in step 4 is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to accomplish step 4 by imposing the slightly more stringent condition that\n",
    "$\\sqrt{(n^2 - n)(Off(A)_{max})^2}\\leq \\epsilon$.  \n",
    "This condition is equivalent to assuming that all off-diagonal elements have a value equal to $Off(A)_{max}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of step four as answering the question \"how diagonal is your matrix?\"  We seek a fully diagonalized form because this will allow us to easily read off the eigenvalues from the diagonal.  Once our matrix is sufficiently close to this form (all non-diagonal elements are sufficiently close to zero) we can say that our diagonal elements approximate the true eigenvalues.  It is also important to note that a similarity transformation, though it does change the eigen $\\it{vectors}$ has no effect on the eigen $\\it{values}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the code below we choose an arbitrary 3X3 matrix A with eigenvalues $\\lambda_n=n$ so that $\\lambda_1=1 \\hspace{0.25cm} \\lambda_2=2....$  To create a case which is analagous to the problem we will solve for the project I will chose the elements on either side of the diagonal to be some small value for now let's say that value is 0.5.  Our matrix A then takes the following form.\n",

    "0  & 0.5 & 3  \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement Jacobi's method we need to apply the similarity transformation using a matrix S.  We construct the specific form of S by first initializing an identity matrix.  We then replace the appropriate elements with $cos(\\theta)$ and $sin(\\theta)$.  This matrix must perform a rotation about some axis.  We chose this axis based on which elements we are trying to bring to zero.  An example of a 3-D rotation matrix is given below.  We will then construct the matrix B via similarity transformation with S.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hspace{3.0cm}\\textbf{S}=\n",

    "\n",
    "We have thus outlined the basic steps, but we should take some time to further describe two things: what the form of S must necessarily be (corresponding to the rotational axis), and how we find the rotational angle ($\\theta$).\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Finding Rotational Axis and Form of S:\n",
    "Let me first introduce a new kind of notation to represent matrix $\\textbf{A}$.  Remember that the goal is to pick out the largest elements according to step 2 and then to chose $\\theta$ such that this element goes to zero.  That means that $\\theta$ will ultimately be determined by our choice of the element we want to zero out.  I call this element the target element and represent it by the target symbol ($\\odot$).  All other elements are of little interest to us for the time being so they are represented by periods (.).  Under this new notation the matrix A becomes and the elment of interest become $a_{\\odot}$\n",

    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    ". & a_{\\odot} & . \\\\\n",
    ". &  . & . \\\\\n",
    ".  & . & .  \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Working out simple similarity transformations by hand quickly reveals that certain elements surrounding the target are also relevent in determing the value of the target spot in the resulting matrix $\\textbf{B}$.  Let the target element now have indices k & l so that $a_{\\odot} = a_{kl}$.  The corresponding element in $\\textbf{B}$ is then $b_{kl} = 0$.  Using a combination of these notations we can yet again recast the matrix $\\textbf{A}$.\n",

    ".  & . & .  \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The algebra for the simple cases tells us that we need to place the cos functions at $s_{kk}=s_{ll}=cos(\\theta)$ and the sin functions at $s_{kl}=-s_{lk}=-sin(\\theta)$.  Following all the rules we have so far established we can construct $\\textbf{S}$ for this case.\n",

    "\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Finding $\\theta$:\n",
    "Now that we have a procedure for finding $\\textbf{S}$ we need to examine how the trigfunctions of $\\textbf{S}$ interact with the elements of interest in $\\textbf{A}$.  Carrying out the multiplication results in an equation for the transformed target element in matrix $\\textbf{B}$. \n",

    "\\end{equation}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So with all of our mathematics we have managed to change the game a little bit.  The goal now is to ensure that we chose theta appropriatley so that $b_{\\odot}=0$.  Setting $b_{\\odot}=0$ in the equation above we conclude that \n",

    "\\end{equation}$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two more things worth noting about the equation above:  The arctangent function is bounded $\\frac{-pi}{4}\\le\\arctan(\\theta)\\le\\frac{pi}{4}$.  The factor of one half fixes the maximum value attainable in our algorithm at $\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{4}$.  You will also notice (if you have been assiduous in your calculation) that I have dropped a negative sign.  that is because I will be using the absolute value of theta in the algorithm and tangent is an odd function anyways so it turns out to be irrelevent (mathematicians forgive me).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### EigenValues and EigenVectors\n",
    "Similarity transformations have the property that they perserve the eigenvalues.  The eigenvectors however, are not preserved.  Luckily the nature of the transformation makes it easy to relate the new eigenvectors to the eigenvectors of your original matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a matrix $\\textbf{A}$ on which we apply our transformation matrix $\\textbf{S}$ to obtain $\\textbf{B} = \\textbf{SA}\\textbf{S}^{-1}$.  Consder $\\vec{v}$, and eigen vector of $\\textbf{A}$ with eigen value $\\lambda$.  Let us define a new eigen vector $\\vec{u}$ = $\\textbf{S}\\vec{v}$.  Now let us examine the properties of this new vector.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If I apply $\\textbf{B}$ onto $\\vec{u}$ I get $B\\vec{u} = \\textbf{SA}\\textbf{S}^{-1}\\textbf{S}\\vec{v}$.  The S and S inverse cancel to give me unity.  Because $\\vec{v}$ is an eigen vector of $\\textbf{A}$ I am left with $\\lambda\\textbf{S}\\vec{v} = \\lambda\\vec{u}$.  This means that $\\vec{u}$ is an eigenvector of $\\textbf{B}$.  We also now have a method for relating the two eigen vectors, namely\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{v} = \\textbf{S}^{-1}\\vec{u}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we are finished finding the eigen vectors of our transformed matrix, which are trivial since it is diagonal.  We can obtain our original eigen vectors by way of this transformation."
